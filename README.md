Environment-Aware-Wordpress-Config
==================================

This is a customized Wordpress wp-config.php that allows loading of custom config files with the convention of wp-config-{environment}.php. The point is to eliminate code changes when moving between environments (local, dev, stage, production, etc). Environments are fully customizable.
